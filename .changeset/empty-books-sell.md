Renaming the discount type from `amount` to `fixedAmount` in the `reaction` prop for the Tokengate component.

This change was made to ensure naming consistency across the Shopify Blockchain ecosystem.

To update your project to align with these changes, see the updated docs at https://shopify.dev/docs/api/blockchain/components/tokengate#reaction.
