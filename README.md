# Blockchain components

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE.md)

A loosely related set of components for blockchain functionality on Shopify storefronts.

These packages are built to help you integrate blockchain functionality on your Shopify storefront. While you are not required to use all of them at the same time, the idea is that when used together the result is a seamless Web3 experience for your customers.

## Usage

This repository is managed as a monorepo. Each package has its own `README.md` and documentation describing usage.
