For more information about configuring providers, view the Wagmi [documentation](https://wagmi.sh/react/providers/configuring-chains).

When initializing the package, it is **strongly** recommended to include an [Alchemy](https://wagmi.sh/react/providers/alchemy) or [Infura](https://wagmi.sh/react/providers/infura) provider to reduce the risk of rate limiting. Rate limiting will render the implementation broken and result in an inability for your customers to make purchases.

:::note

From the Wagmi [documentation](https://wagmi.sh/react/providers/configuring-chains#multiple-providers) for multiple providers,

> The `configureChains` function accepts multiple providers.
>
> `configureChains` wraps the providers that you provide into an [ethers.js `FallbackProvider`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/other/#FallbackProvider), that comes with support for:
>
> - Falling back to another provider if a provider goes down (e.g. If Infura goes down, we can fall back to Alchemy)
> - Ensuring the responses are legitimate by setting a targetQuorum.
