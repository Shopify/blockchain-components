Connectors, also frequently referred to as wallets, are how users connect to their prefered wallet application. We provide a collection of connectors that are available for use out of the box that you can use or modify to your liking.

Currently, the default connectors that are supported are:
- MetaMask
- Coinbase
- Ledger Live (see note)
- Rainbow
- WalletConnect

Ledger Live

Ledger Live is currently supported via WalletConnect as oppposed to Ledger Connect Kit. The reasoning for this is that Ledger Connect Kit is not yet publicly available, and is additionally not supported by anything outside of iOS and macOS devices using Safari.
