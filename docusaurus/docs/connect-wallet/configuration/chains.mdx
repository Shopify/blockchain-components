The chains supported for `@shopify/connect-wallet` are inline with [wagmi's supported chains](https://wagmi.sh/react/chains#supported-chains).

## Customizing which chains to use

In the `connect-wallet-config.ts` file you created during initial [configuration](./#wagmi-configuration), change the value for chains specified during `configureChains` like so:

```typescript
// ...other imports
import {polygon} from 'wagmi/chains';

const {chains, provider, webSocketProvider} = configureChains(
  [polygon, {/* any other chains you would like to provide go here */}],
  [publicProvider()],
);

// ...other configuration
```
